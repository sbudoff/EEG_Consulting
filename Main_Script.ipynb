    "# EEG Cannabis Sleep Consulting Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Few things are more universally important than sleep. Indeed it features prominantly at the botom of Maslow's famous hierarchy of needs along other non-negotiable parts of life like breathing. Unfortunately, many medical conditions impact patient's ability to sleep, weather by inhibiting sleep onset or by generally reducing sleep quality. The consequences of this sleep deprivation are well documented in the medical and scientific literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy some patients have adopted to mitigate their percieved sleep problems is to self medicate with cannabis. Cannabis, among other side effects, is known to induce calm and even drowsineess in some users. Unfortuantely, due to the controversial political history surrounding this area, little is known quantitatively about the efficacy of such practices. Indeed, it is plausible that while a self-reported drowsiness may occur to some patients, the quality of sleep while under the influence of cannibis may be abnormal or otherwise inferior to unmedicated slep. On the other hand, perhapse for some patient populations use of cannabis may improve quality of sleep and ultimately treat symptomologies that are caused by sleep deprivation as opposed to the physiologic abnormalities underlying their illness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The present study seeks to investigate such possibilities, one way or another, in order to justify and direct more systematic clinical investigations. To do so, a patient cohort including adult patients with various psychologic or physiologic coniditions was recruited to sleep with an EEG recording device. Patientis who self medicate with cannabis to aid in sleep, or not, were asked to perform what ever sleep rituals they normally do and to report these activities in a sleep journal associated with the study period. Patient demographics with regard to disease state, cannabis useage, gender, and age were documented by a qualified medical proffessional prior to annonymization of the EEG data. Samples of patient EEG data from these expert defined demographic groupings was then randomely sampled and assessed in an unbiased manner to extract relevant trends. Sleep quality has historically been assessed by comparing sonomnographic features, such as wake after sleep events, time to sleep onset, time in specific sleep phases, and the power of specific neural activity bands at specified cranial locations. These metrics were extracted and assessed in aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods Daft for Manuscript\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient data from 1XX sleep trials were recorded under supervision, and annotation of qualified technicians. The patient sleep journals documenting cannibis use or not, as well as relevant demographics were assessed by a qualified medical proffessional prior to annonymization. A table linking electrophysiologic data ID with study relevant demografics was created and stored on a scure Cluster with the anonymyzed electrophysiologic raw data as European Data Format (EDF) files, as well as with xml archives containing technician and machine annotated metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple sampling without replacement strategy was implemented to subsample the patient data to create balanced samples of observations from each demographic condition of interest. The anonymous ID for each patient was then used to automatically parse the edf and xml data associated with that patient. The xml data was converted into python dictionaries for easy parsing, and was used to first identify if any technician notes disqualify the patient for technical reasons. This metadata was then used to extract and store the time at which the lights were turned off and on. The edf file was loaded into python with the MNE package. \n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the electrophysiology, data was cleaned by downsampling from the original 250 Hz to 100 Hz and bandpass filtering the range from 0.1 to 40 Hz. The YAMA package was then implemented for automatic sleep stage scoring. All four combinations of C3 and C4 located EEG and the two available EMG traces was performed, and the probabilities were average to classify the sleep stage at every 30 second interval. The first time point classified as non-REM level 1 (N1) after the lights were turned off was classified as the initiation of sleep. Meanwhile the amount of time between lights off and sleep onset was stored for each patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was then subset to include the first, second, third and fourht hour after sleep onset. The amount of time in each stage, as classified by YAMA, was recorded for each of these time periods. The number of wake after sleep events were recorded for each of these time periods. All electrophysiology associated with wake predictions was then removed from the data set for each time period. Using the multitaper spectral estimation of frequency power for 0.1 to 40 Hz a power estimation curve for each time point was produced via the algorithm as implemented in the MNE package with default hyperparameters. The YAMA package was then used to estimate the area under the curve for each electrophysiologically relevant frequency range to estimate band power for each electrode at each time point. These band power estimates were then stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extraction of the relevant statistics from each patient in a group. Interquartile values were computed for each, such that for the relevant statistics the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values were recorded for each demographic group. Values were then compared with appropriate data visualizations. Non-parametric statistical tests, such as the Mann Whitney U test were applied to combinations of demographics bearing interest based on these group wise data visualizations. All analysis and data cleaning was performed in python with code available at X.\n",

    "This notebook contains a broken down version of the full scripting methods. As such each section includes the helper functions called by the main scripting function, with example usage in a global enviorment. The purpose ans structure of this notebook is thus to clearly teach the behavior of each helper function, as well as how they can be used piecemeal in a future project outside of the core script for this manuscript.\n",

    "The dataset consists of two main file types, an edf trace file consisting of electrophysiology, and a rml containing metadata such as technician notes. Standard python libraries are used for data loading, visualization, and manipulation. Speciailized functions from the MNE library allow for reading and manipulation of the edf data. The main pages for these functions can be found here: \n",
